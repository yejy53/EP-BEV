This repository contains the official implementation of the paper: Cross-view image geo-localization with Panorama-BEV Co-Retrieval Network. It is a very effective cross-view retrieval framework by adding an additional street view BEV retrieval branch. It achieves leading performance on multiple datasets, including VIGOR, CVUSA to CVACT retrieval.

## Installation
Clone this repo to a local folder:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yejy53/EP-BEV.git
cd EP-BEV
```

## Environment Setup

```bash
conda create -n EP-BEV python=3.9 -y
conda activate EP-BEV
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If huggingface cannot download the weights successfully, you can add export HF_ENDPOINT="https://hf-mirror.com" at the end of .bashrc and reactivate it.

## Use our pre-trained model for retrieval 
1. You can download a pre-trained model (e.g. cvact) from [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/Yejy53/EB-BEV-CVACT/tree/main) and place it in ckpt folder.
2. You need to organize the generated BEV images into the above dataset format. You can download the generated BEV images directly from the following [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Yejy53/CVACT-BEV) link to get consistent results, or generate BEV images yourself and then retrain.
3. When performing Street View-BEV Co-Retrieval, you only need to add the similarity of using a pure Street View image to the similarity of using a BEV image. The weights for using Street View search can be obtained from the following [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/Yejy53/CVACT-Street/tree/main) link. The method and weights for using Street View search also can be found in the [Sample4G](https://github.com/Skyy93/Sample4Geo).
